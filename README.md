# BrailleBuddy
BrailleBuddy is an app designed to detect Braille letter patterns using camera or gallery input. It was developed as a capstone project for the **Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch 2** Independent Study Program by a team of seven members. The team is divided into three specializations: **one members in the Mobile Learning Path, two in the Cloud Computing Path, and three in the Machine Learning Path.**
Kotlin is used as the main language in this application.
